### Projects

* Work Projects
  * 2010-2012, Trudio
    * Trudio is a reverse engineering assistant tool for heavily obfuscated binary executables. It includes instruction level execution trace extractor developed using [Pintool](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool) and trace analyzer implemented in [Java](). Prototype of the trace analyzer was implemented using [Python]() and [wxPython]().
    * You can download the trace extractor and trace analyzer [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/trudio/downloads). Paper is [here](http://giyeok.com/assets/thesis.pdf)(korean). Source code is not open.
  * 2012-2013, Tizen SDK and webida, S-Core
  * 2014-2015, KakaoTalk server, Kakao
  * 2016-2017, Rework app server, Thenully

* Personal Projects
  * 2009, Giyeok programming language, A scripting language <a class="btn btn-default narrow" href="https://github.com/joonsoo/giyeok"><i class="fa fa-2 fa-github"></i>GitHub</a>
    * A script language made just for fun while taking a programming language course <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>

  * 2013, Tournament manager, Web-based tournament game manager
    * A private project to manage a tournament match. It successfully held several tournament matches with dozens of players.

  * 2013, Gitexplorer, Git repository visualization tool <a class="btn btn-default narrow" href="https://github.com/joonsoo/gitexplorer"><i class="fa fa-2 fa-github"></i>GitHub</a>

  * 2013-2017, Dexdio, Dalvik executable reverse engineering tool <a class="btn btn-default narrow" href="https://github.com/joonsoo/dexdio"><i class="fa fa-2 fa-github"></i>GitHub</a>

  * 2013-2017, J Parser, A scannerless parser implementation <a class="btn btn-default narrow" href="https://github.com/joonsoo/jparser"><i class="fa fa-2 fa-github"></i>GitHub</a>
    * I proposed Conditional Derivation Grammar(CDG), that extends Context-Free Grammar with new features: longest match, intersection, exclusion, followed-by, and not-followed-by. It is designed to be capable of integrating lexical grammar and CFG, and modeling modern programming languages. I also devised a parsing algorithm for CDG, and J Parser is an implementation.
    * The proposed algorithm may run in exponential time complexity to the length of the input string. However, it is only the hypothetical upper bound of the time complexity, and I expect the algorithm to run in time complexity in real usages.
    * The implementation is written in Scala. It also provides visualization using [SWT](https://www.eclipse.org/swt/), Eclipse [draw2d](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/draw2d/) and [zest](https://www.eclipse.org/gef/zest/).

  * 2017, Passzero, Secure password manager <a class="btn btn-default narrow" href="https://github.com/joonsoo/passzero"><i class="fa fa-2 fa-github"></i>GitHub</a>
    * A clone of 1password for personal use. It randomly creates a private key file on local storage encrypted with user defined password in initialization stage, and saves encrypted password information on DropBox using its APIs.
    * It is written in Scala. The GUI was implemented using SWT, but I am working on a new version of GUI using JavaFX for a better compatibility.
