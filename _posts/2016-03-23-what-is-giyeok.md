> I have been using nickname "giyeok" for years and owned giyeok.com as well. "Giyeok(기역)" is the name of the first letter of Korean writing system, [Hangul(한글)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul). I love Hangul. Hangul is a beautifully designed writing system, and it was invented with the love for the normal public people.

# Why do I love Hangul so much?

Hangul, which was originally named [Hunminjeongeum(훈민정음)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum), was invented and published in 1446 by [King Sejong the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_the_Great).

Korean people have been using its own language. Korean people, however, did not have proper way to write Korean language before Hangul was invented. Thus, most of the documents were written in Chinese language with Chinese letters.
But Korean language is very different from Chinese language, and furthermore, Chinese writing system has tens of thousands characters of different shapes and different meaning. Therefore, only small number of highly educated people could read and write.

King Sejong felt great sorry for this situation. He tried to teach the normal public people about morality. He tried to spread the knowledge about farming and silkworm farming, which were the main two economic activities at the time. But he had trouble with the writing system every time he tried to spread ideas or knowledge.

He first tried using [Idu(이두) script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idu_script), which was a writing system to write Korean with Chinese characters. It, however, was still too difficult for the uneducated normal people.
He also tried to let civil servants to translate and read the books to public, but it also did not work very well.

Finally, he decided to invent a new writing system for Korean language, and he invented the new writing system after an extensive research on many existing writing systems and cutting-edge phonology. As a result, he published [Hunminjeongeum Haerye(훈민정음 해례; Hunminjeongeum was the original version of Hangul, Haerye means description and examples)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum_Haerye) in 1446.

Surprisingly, most intellectuals and politicians desperately opposed with King Sejong about the new writing system. They believed that educating or enlightening public peple would be disaster. They believed that the uneducated people who can read and write would abuse the law and rules, so eventually lead the entire society into chaos.

King Sejong, however, was different. He believed every person, even a lower class person, can be improved by learning. It was a very progressive thought since Korean society was very conservative at the time and he was a king indeed.

I think this attitude of being respectful and loving to the normal public people makes him the only king we named "great" among 27 kings of Joseon dynasty, which was the kingdom ruled the Korean territory from 1392 to 1910. Even the founder of Joseon is not called "great".

I believe we, software engineers, have something in common with King Sejong in philosophy. We are trying to improve people's lives by spreading the knowledge and by utilizing new scientific achievements, just like he did hundreds years ago.


# What does Hangul look like?

I am not an expert of linguistics, so I guess [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul) can give you more detail and precise explanation about Hangul, but I want to briefly describe it here.

Basically, each letter of Hangul represents one syllable. A letter is composed of one or more consonants and one vowel. Thus, Hangul has separate two sets of letters for consonants and vowels (and giyeok is the name of the first letter of the consonant letters).

### Consonants

The consonant letters are generally listed as ㄱㄴㄷㄹㅁㅂㅅㅇㅈㅊㅋㅌㅍㅎ. (ㄱ g, ㄴ n, ㄷ d, ㄹ l/r, ㅁ m, ㅂ b, ㅅ s, ㅇ null/ng, ㅈ j, ㅊ ch, ㅋ k, ㅌ t, ㅍ p, ㅎ h)

[Hunminjeongeum Haerye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum_Haerye) describes how these letters are designed. It says ㄱ and ㄴ are designed after the shape of the tongue when the sound is pronounced, ㅁ is designed after the shape of lips, ㅅ is designed after the shape of teeth, and ㅇ is designed after the shape of neck. These five letters are called basic consonant letters, and ㄷ d, ㅂ b, ㅈ j, ㅊ ch, ㅋ k, ㅌ t, ㅍ p, and ㅎ h are derived from these letters by adding new dot or line to the basic letters. Haerye describes ㄹ is designed after the shape of tongue and teeth, but there are some arguments of how this letter is actually designed.

We can summarize the consonant letters in a table like the following:

|------|------|------|
| ㄱ g |      | ㅋ k |
| ㄴ n | ㄷ d | ㅌ t |
| ㅁ m | ㅂ b | ㅍ p |
| ㅅ s | ㅈ j | ㅊ ch |
| ㅇ null/ng | | ㅎ h |
| ㄹ l/r | | |

Lastly, five "double letters" are added into the group of consonant letters: ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, and ㅉ. These are tense version of ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, and ㅈ, respectively. You can see these double letters are literally doubled-version of the original letters.

In conclusion, the consonant letters are designed with two simple principles: they are modeled after the shapes of vocal organs or adding new line or dots to another letter (or doubling).


### Vowels

The vowels are generally listed as ㅏㅑㅓㅕㅗㅛㅜㅠㅡㅣ. (ㅏ a, ㅑ ya, ㅓ eo, ㅕ yeo, ㅗ o, ㅛ yo, ㅜ u, ㅠ yu, ㅡ eu, ㅣ i)

[Haerye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunminjeongeum_Haerye) says that the vowel letters are designed based on the eastern philosophy that thinks the world is composed of sky, earth, and human. Sky is represented as dot, earth is as horizontal line, and human is as vertical line. It makes sense if you understand that ㅏ is the vertical line with dot on the right side, ㅑ is the vertical line with two dots on the right side, ㅓ is the vertical line with dot on the left side, ㅗ is the horizontal line with dot on the upper side, and so on.

These vowel letters can be synthesized to represent more complex sounds. One example is ㅢ. It is just a composition of ㅡ and ㅣ, and it sounds as "ui", which sounds like a shortened version of ㅡ eu and ㅣ i. These compounding vowels include ㅐ ae, ㅒ yae, ㅔ e, ㅖ ye, ㅢ ui, ㅘ wa, ㅙ wae, ㅚ oe, ㅝ wo, ㅞ we, and ㅟ wi.


### Complete letters

Finally, a complete Hangul letter is made of one or more consonants and one vowel.
A consonant is placed at the left-upper side of the vowel i.e. 가 ga, 그 geu, or 긔 gui. This mandatory first consonant is called initial(초성), and the only vowel is called medial(중성).
And a Hangul letter can have one more consonant at the bottom of the letter i.e. 각 gag, 극 geug, or 긕 guig. This optional consonant is called final(종성).

Some letters can have a cluster of consonants in this final position i.e. 젊, 맑, or 않. These consonant cluster does not have new sound, but it represents an interaction with the following letter. For example, 젊다 and 젊은 both have the character 젊, but 젊다 is read as 점따, while 젊은 is as 절믄. In the former case, ㄹ from 젊 is ignored, while in the latter case, ㄹ is NOT ignored and ㅁ replaces the initial sound of the following letter.
11 clustered consonants are used in modern Korean. There are several rules to read those clustered consonants, and they are not very difficult, but I don't want to cover them here.

I guess this is pretty much everything.


Note that a complete Hangul character is in square shape. I guess it had to be in square shape since Hangul used to be written vertically (Most modern Hangul is written horizontally).


### Hunminjeongeum and Hangul

In fact, Hangul is a simplified version of Hunminjeongeum, the original version of invention by King Sejong. It had more basic consonants, more double consonants, more synthesized consonants, more synthesized vowels, and so on. It even had the notation for pitch accent.
However, I guess the basic principles are the same, and the simplification is just a reflection of the change in Korean language.
The objective of Hunminjeongeum was to invent a general and universal writing system to write every vocal sound properly, but we don't need some of the characters of Hunminjeongeum in modern Korean langauge.
